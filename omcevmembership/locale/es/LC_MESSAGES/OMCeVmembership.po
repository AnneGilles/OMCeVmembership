#. Default: When you are releasing a thing under a Creative Commons license

#. away
#. for free for so-called non-commercial use. It may not be used commercially.
#. At
#. least not without your permission.
#: omcevmembership/templates/ideas.pt:13
msgid "nc-commercial-text-1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: So there is a commercial aspect of NC licenses. Licensees indending
#. to
#. use your work must talk to you and have your permission. We will offer this
#. functionality through our service, as a one-stop shop for all institutions
#. or
#. companies searching for content.
#: omcevmembership/templates/ideas.pt:19
msgid "nc-commercial-text-2"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Imagine you could set a fee for your work to be used, maybe
#. depending
#. on that institutions type or a companies size. Licensees would be able to
#. see
#. how much it would be for them to use it, possibly preview your work and then
#. license it.

msgid "nc-commercial-text-3"

#. Default: Please fill out this form and submit it. You will get a PDF

#. your bank account in an automatized way, add information about your bank
#. account. Then print the document and sign it and finally mail it back to us.

msgid "history1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: GEMA, the one and only collecting society with regard to music in
#. germany has been a problem and sometimes a real show-stopper. Every time you
#. want to have a CD produced, you need their allowance. Even if the CDs
#. contents
#. were entirely GEMA-free.
#: omcevmembership/templates/why.pt:24
msgid "history2"
msgstr ""

#. Default: GEMA does not support Creative Commons Licenses. The artists
#. registered
#. are not free to release their music the way they want. That's not going to
#. change.
#: omcevmembership/templates/why.pt:32
msgid "reason1"

#. Default: Likewise, artists who do not join GEMA for whatever reasons have no
