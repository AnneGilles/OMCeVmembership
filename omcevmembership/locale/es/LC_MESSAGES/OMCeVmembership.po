#. Default: When you are releasing a thing under a Creative Commons license

#. away
#. for free for so-called non-commercial use. It may not be used commercially.
#. At
#. least not without your permission.
#: omcevmembership/templates/ideas.pt:13
msgid "nc-commercial-text-1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: So there is a commercial aspect of NC licenses. Licensees indending
#. to
#. use your work must talk to you and have your permission. We will offer this
#. functionality through our service, as a one-stop shop for all institutions
#. or
#. companies searching for content.
#: omcevmembership/templates/ideas.pt:19
msgid "nc-commercial-text-2"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Imagine you could set a fee for your work to be used, maybe
#. depending
#. on that institutions type or a companies size. Licensees would be able to
#. see
#. how much it would be for them to use it, possibly preview your work and then
#. license it.

msgid "history1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: GEMA, the one and only collecting society with regard to music in

#. contents
#. were entirely GEMA-free.
#: omcevmembership/templates/why.pt:24
msgid "history2"
msgstr ""

#. Default: GEMA does not support Creative Commons Licenses. The artists
